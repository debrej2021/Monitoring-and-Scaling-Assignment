I have created a Lambda function 
create_s3_deb_sept25 on console to test this boto3 code 

for creating s3 - create_s3.py
for creating EC2 and deploying - create_ec2.py
for creating alb- create_alb.py
for creating asg - create_asg.py
for SNS topics - create_sns_topics.py
for creating and tearing infra - create_tear_infra.py

Assosciated screen shots attached 

The only thing is the nginx server couldnt be tested because of some issues but I am sure the code should work
